# Building this Software

This project uses packages from NuGET. It was built using Visual Studio 2015.

The following external packages are used:
* HtmlRenderer.Core.1.5.0.6
* HtmlRenderer.WinForms.1.5.0.6
* HtmlAgilityPack.1.4.9.5

Since upgrading to 1.5.0.6 for all versions, there is no need to do anything
special to get the project working correctly in the IDE.
